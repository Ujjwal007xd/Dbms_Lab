-- Count and Order by Subject
SELECT subject, COUNT(*) AS student_count

-- Sum of Marks (assuming marks column existed - this will throw error unless added)
-- Let's assume we skip or add that column if needed later
-- SELECT SUM(marks) AS total_marks  
-- FROM student  
-- WHERE subject = 'History';

-- Pattern Matching Examples
SELECT * FROM student WHERE name LIKE 'A%';     -- Starts with A
SELECT * FROM student WHERE name LIKE '%a';     -- Ends with a
SELECT * FROM student WHERE name LIKE '%a%';    -- Contains 'a'
SELECT * FROM student WHERE name LIKE '_r%';    -- Second letter is r
SELECT * FROM student WHERE name LIKE 'a_%_%';  -- Starts with a, has at least 3 letters
SELECT * FROM student WHERE name LIKE 'a%o';    -- Starts with a, ends with o
